## Overview 

<ins>__Language__</ins>: Python3  

<ins>__Completed on__</ins>: February 8th, 2023

A spam classifier.

A spam classifier utilizing Scikit-Learn, [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org) (NLTK), and Python's ["pandas"](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) library to implement multiple classification algorithms of machine learning. Trained and tested on a [spambase set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) of over 5,000 SMS. Can be used to detect whether a message is spam or not, and can also be used to supply detailed information regarding a classifier's accuracy score and/or AUC score &mdash; or even plot its confusion matrix. 

Implementation based on Git repos from [VaibhavMagon](https://github.com/vaibhavmagon/Python-Spam-Ham-SMS), [Krishnaik06](https://github.com/krishnaik06/SpamClassifier), and [The-Fang](https://github.com/the-fang/Spam-mail-filtering).

## To Do

This program is fully implemented; however, it needs to be tested and debugged.

## Usage

Run `classifier.py` with Python3 on the command line. It should look something like this:

```
$ python3 classifier.py
```
